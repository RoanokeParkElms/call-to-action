## Why trust Jim Simpkins?

For over thirty years, Jim has advocated for the Roanoke Park neighborhood:

- Two-term community council president
- Long-time neighborhood representative to NE District Council
- Neighborhood liaison to WSDOT for the SR520 expansion projects
- Graffiti removal and bus stop beautification
- Emergency preparedness
- Tending to Roanoke Park's greenery

After Erin O'Connor's death in 2011, Jim has been spearheading the elm inoculation effort - collecting and disbursing funds, coordinating with property owners, and arranging for arborists to treat the elm trees with inoculations, root treatments, and pruning. After watching elm trees drop dead from Dutch Elm Disease in his native Connecticut, Jim is committed to making sure that doesn't happen here.
