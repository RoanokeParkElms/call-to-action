## Dutch Elm Disease threatens our elm trees

It's almost impossible to imagine the area around Roanoke Park without its glorious elm trees. But Dutch Elm Disease could wipe all of them out in a single season. The only way to protect the trees is a fungicide inoculation every three years by a licensed arborist. Each tree costs between $600 and $975 to inoculate; our goal is to raise $11,000 to keep the trees healthy for the next three to six years.

## How to help

We are asking everyone who enjoys Roanoke Park's elm trees to consider donating to keep these magnificent trees healthy. This four-minute video describes the problem and its only known solution.

## If we exceed our fundraising goal

Because of the astounding generosity of neighbors and friends, it looks like we will exceed the goal we had set. But the trees require inoculation every three years, so all donations above our goal will be put into a dedicated account and applied to future treatments.

## Two ways to donate

By far the simplest way is to use a credit card through this secure GoFundMe link. **Note: Be sure to set the "tip" amount to zero!** (GoFundMe keeps 100% of the "tip", and they already charge us a fee on every donation):

But if you'd prefer, you can send a check, made payable to Jim Simpkins ([why should you trust Jim?](./jim-simpkins.html)), with "Elm trees" in the memo line, to:

Either way, *thank you*. If you don't get a thank-you message from us within a day or two of your donation, let us know by email.
