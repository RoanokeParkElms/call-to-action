# How to help

Please watch this four-minute video to learn more about the grave threat to Roanoke Park's elms. Then consider donating to keep these magnificent trees healthy for another three years.

## Two ways to donate

The simplest way is to use a credit card through this secure GoFundMe link:

<div class="gfm-embed" data-url="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-protect-roanoke-parks-elms/widget/medium?sharesheet=fundraiser sidebar&attribution_id=undefined"></div><script defer src="https://www.gofundme.com/static/js/embed.js"></script>
But if you'd prefer, you can send a check, made payable to Jim Simpkins, with "Elm trees" in the memo line, to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Simpkins<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2823 Broadway E<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle, WA 98102

In either case, thank you!
