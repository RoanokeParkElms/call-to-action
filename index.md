## Dutch Elm Disease threatens our elm trees

It's almost impossible to imagine the area around Roanoke Park without its glorious elm trees. But Dutch Elm Disease could wipe all of them out in a single season. The only way to protect the trees is a fungicide inoculation every three years by a licensed arborist. Each tree costs between $600 and $975 to inoculate; our goal is to raise $9,500 to keep the trees healthy for the next three years.

## How to help

We are asking everyone who enjoys Roanoke Park's elm trees to consider donating to keep these magnificent trees healthy. This four-minute video describes the problem and the solution.

## Two ways to donate

By far the simplest way is to use a credit card through this secure GoFundMe link. **Note: Be sure to set the "tip" amount to zero!** (We don't get any of that "tip", and they already charge us a fee on every donation.)
